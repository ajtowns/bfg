# Investor Review Phase

| Buy-In : **Investors**, **Miners**, **Auditors** |
| Support : **Researchers**, **Protocol Developers**, **Power Users**, **Industry** |

In some sense investors always get the final word on what "Bitcoin" is --
they decide what software they run to audit their ownership and global
supply, they collectively decide what the ticker points at, they decide
how to price Bitcoin in terms of other currencies, and they decide what
features they will and won't use when storing and spending their coins.

Having investor review as the final phase of establishing social consensus
thus serves two purposes: it acknowledges that investors have the final
say, and it also gives them the benefit of all the effort and results from
the previous phases, to make their final decision a more informed one.

The goal at this phase is thus to ensure that the previous phases were
executed in good faith and were complete -- that the proposal has been
reviewed by researchers, is able to be implemented as planned, and fits
in well in the ecosystem, and, if activated, will be quickly ready for
productive use.
