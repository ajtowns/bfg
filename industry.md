# Industry Evaluation Phase

| Work : **Industry**, **Protocol Developers** |
| Buy-In : **Industry** |
| Monitor : *Researchers*, *Power Users* |

Most changes to Bitcoin will have some impact on existing Bitcoin
businesses. This phase is about ensuring that those impacts are
understood, that any negative impacts are far outweighed by the
positive, and, ultimately, that the impacts are large enough to be
worth the effort.

At a minimum, this involves contacting impacted projects, talking to
the people maintaining them, and seeing if the change integrates easily,
and if any problems can be resolved. If you find things to improve here,
it's important to go back and improve them, whether that's a small tweak
to the implementation or a major redesign.

Ideally, it would be desirable to have experimental releases of affected
products that include updates to support or adapt to the proposed changes.
For open source products, this may be something that proposal authors can
achieve independently.

The goal at this stage is to demonstrate that the proposal lives up to
its potential at a technical level. That it's promised gains are large
enough to warrant involvement from industry, and that the implementation
works as promised.
