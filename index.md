# Approach

This guide advocates the approach of ***consensus before consensus***
that it is important to establish social consensus in favour of a change
prior to changing the consensus code that will make the change reality.

The process of establishing social consensus is split into four stages:

 1. [Research and Development](research)
 2. [Power User Exploration](power)
 3. [Industry Evaluation](industry)
 4. [Investor Review](investor)

Once social consensus is established and robust via completion of each
of these phases, it is comparatively straightforward to then deploy the
consensus code changes, giving the final two phases:

# Roles

This guide categorises participants into the following roles:

 * Researchers -- Academic interest in Bitcoin related areas, and detailed
   high-level research, worst case analysis, etc.
 * Power Users -- People who have a practical interest in Bitcoin,
   and a high-level of willingness to experiment with new things.
 * Protocol Developers -- People who implement/review consensus logic.
 * Industry -- People who builds software and services that take advantage
   of and rely on Bitcoin. The technical/programmer part of Bitcoin businesses.
 * Entrepreneurs -- The risk-seeking part of Bitcoin businesses.
 * Investors -- People who hold Bitcoin as a store of value
 * Miners -- People who participate in block-building and transaction
   ordering (particularly pool maintainers, hashrate controllers)
 * Auditors -- People who audit Bitcoin’s supply and ownership (the
   accounting/financial side; see "Protocol Developers" for the coding
   side)
 * Maintainers -- People who maintain and release node software

These roles are not in any way exclusive; for example many Protocol
Developers will also be Researchers or part of Industry, many Miners
will also be Entrepreneurs, and many people who have another role will
also be Investors.
