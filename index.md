# Approach

This guide advocates the approach of ***consensus before consensus***
that it is important to establish social consensus in favour of a change
prior to changing the consensus code that will make the change reality.

The process of establishing social consensus is split into four stages:

 1. [Research and Development](research)
 2. [Power User Exploration](power)
 3. [Industry Evaluation](industry)
 4. [Investor Review](investor)

Once social consensus is established and robust via completion of each
of these phases, it is comparatively straightforward to then deploy the
consensus code changes, giving the final two phases:

 6. [Activation](activation)

# Roles

This guide categorises participants into the following roles:

 * Independent technical experts
   * **Researchers** -- Academic interest in Bitcoin related areas, and detailed
     high-level research, worst case analysis, etc.
   * **Protocol Developers** -- People who implement/review consensus logic.
   * **Power Users** -- People who have a practical interest in Bitcoin,
     and a high-level of willingness to experiment with new things in the Bitcoin
     space.
   * **Maintainers** -- People who maintain and release node software
     such as Bitcoin Core.
 * Bitcoin businesses
   * **Industry** -- People who build software and services that take advantage
     of and rely on Bitcoin. The technical/programmer side of Bitcoin businesses.
   * **Entrepreneurs** -- The risk-seeking side of Bitcoin businesses.
   * **Miners** -- People who participate in block-building and transaction
     ordering (particularly pool maintainers, hashrate controllers).
 * Oversight
   * **Investors** -- People who hold Bitcoin as a store of value, invest in Bitcoin
     businesses, etc.
   * **Auditors** -- People who audit Bitcoin's supply and ownership (the
     accounting/financial side; see "Protocol Developers" for the coding
     side).

These roles are not in any way exclusive; for example many Protocol
Developers will also be Researchers or part of Industry, many Miners
will also be Entrepreneurs to some degree, and many people who have
another role will also be Investors.
