# Bitcoin Forking Guide

## Approach

This guide advocates the approach of ***consensus before consensus***
that it is important to establish social consensus in favour of a change
prior to changing the consensus code that will make the change reality.

The process of establishing social consensus is split into four stages:

 1. [Research and Development](research)
 2. [Power User Exploration](power)
 3. [Industry Evaluation](industry)
 4. [Investor Review](investor)

Once social consensus is established and robust, it is comparatively
straightforward to then deploy the consensus code changes.
